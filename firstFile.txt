Raindrops tapped gently against the window, creating a soothing rhythm.  
The distant sound of thunder echoed through the night, signaling a coming storm.Rain began to fall, soft at first, then heavier, drumming rhythmically on rooftops.  
In the distance, a stray cat darted under an awning, its eyes glowing in the dim light.  
A figure in a long coat stood by the fountain, unmoving, as if waiting for something.  
The wind picked up, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and old books.  
A soft melody, barely audible, drifted through the air, lingering like a forgotten memory.  
Suddenly, the clouds parted, revealing a full moon, casting everything in a silver glow.  
The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink.  
A cool breeze swept through the trees, rustling the leaves in a soft whisper.
