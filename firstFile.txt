In the heart of the quiet town, the clock tower struck midnight, echoing through empty streets.  
A single lamplight flickered, casting dancing shadows along the cobblestone path.  
Rain began to fall, soft at first, then heavier, drumming rhythmically on rooftops.  
In the distance, a stray cat darted under an awning, its eyes glowing in the dim light.  
A figure in a long coat stood by the fountain, unmoving, as if waiting for something.  
The wind picked up, carrying with it the scent of damp earth and old books.  
A soft melody, barely audible, drifted through the air, lingering like a forgotten memory.  
Suddenly, the clouds parted, revealing a full moon, casting everything in a silver glow.  
The figure turned and slowly walked away, disappearing into the mist.  
And in that moment, the town seemed to hold its breath, waiting for dawn.
